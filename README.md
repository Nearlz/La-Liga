# La-Liga
 This repository is for personal purpose, but can be worked by everyone who wants. I just want to improve my skills and gain some knowledge about data analysis and interpretation, and prediction with machine learning.
The dataset used for this work is one about football players of LaLiga, the general work is done in python, with matplotlib for graphics, pandas for the tables and dataframes and numpy for numeric exercises.

I have not implemented machine learning yet, just data analysis with some graphics, i will wait until I end this section first.

This section will be updated with the description of the project as soon as I keep working on it.
